# Introduction to Data Analytics

* Analytics is at the heart of modern business. Virtually every organization collects large quantities of data about its customers, products, employees, and service offerings.
* Managers naturally seek to analyze that data and harness the information it contains to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and profitability of their work.
* The ultimate role of a data analyst is to transform raw data into actionable insights that guide decision-making processes within an organization. 
* This involves several key responsibilities and skills.

# Data Collection and Preparation:

* Sourcing data from various channels, including databases, spreadsheets, and external sources,
* Cleaning and organizing the data to ensure it is accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis.

# Data Analysis:

* Employing statistical methods, machine learning techniques, or other analytic tools to interpret data,
* Identifying trends, patterns, and correlations that might not be immediately obvious.

# Data Visualization and Storytelling:

* Creating visual representations of the data, such as charts, graphs, and dashboards, to make complex information easily understandable,
* Articulating findings in a compelling narrative to communicate the significance of the data to stakeholders.

# Decision Support:

* Making recommendations based on data-driven insights to help guide business decisions,
* Providing context around the data, including potential implications and future trends.

# Collaboration and Communication:

* Working closely with other departments, such as marketing, finance, and operations, to understand their data needs and provide insights,
* Effectively communicating complex data findings in a clear and concise manner to non-technical stakeholders,
Continuous Learning and Adaptation:

# Continuous Learning and Adaptation

* Keeping up-to-date with the latest industry trends, tools, and technologies in data analysis.
* Adapting to new types of data and analytical methods as the organization's needs evolve.

# Analytics is made possible by:

* modern data, storage, and computing capabilities.

# Analytics techniques

* Descriptive analytics, which answers the question, “What happened?”
* Diagnostic analytics, which answers the question, “Why did this happen?”
* Predictive analytics, which answers the question, “What might happen in the future?”
* Prescriptive analytics, which answers the question, “What should we do next?”

# Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Deep Learning

* Machine learning (ML) - is a subset of AI techniques. ML techniques attempt to apply statistics to data problems in an effort to discover new knowledge.
 Or, in other terms, ML techniques are AI techniques designed to learn.
* Artificial intelligence (AI) - includes any type of technique where you are attempting to get a computer system to imitate human behavior. 
 as the name implies, you are trying to ask computer systems to artificially behave as if they were intelligent. Now, of course, it is not possible for a modern computer to function at the level of complex reasoning found in the human mind, but you can try to mimic some small portions of human behavior and judgment.
* Deep learning - is a further subdivision of machine learning that uses quite complex techniques, known as neural networks, to discover knowledge in a particular way. It is a highly specialized subfield of machine learning that is most commonly used for image, video, and sound analysis.

# Data element

* A data element is an attribute about a person, place, or thing containing data within a range of values. Data elements also describe characteristics of activities, including orders, transactions, and events. 

# Data type

* A data type limits the values a data element can have. 
* Tabular data is data organized into a table, made up of columns and rows. A table represents information about a single topic. Each column represents a uniquely named field within a table, also called a variable, about a single characteristic. The contents of each column contain values for the data element as defined by the column header

# Structured data

* Structured data is tabular in nature and organized into rows and columns. Structured data is what typically comes to mind when looking at a spreadsheet. With clearly defined column headings, spreadsheets are easy to work with and understand. In a spreadsheet, cells are where columns and rows intersect.

# Character data

* The character data type limits data entry to only valid characters. Characters can include the alphabet that you might see on your keyboard, as well as numbers. Depending on your needs, multiple data types are available that can enforce character limits.

# Alphanumeric

* Alphanumeric is the most widely used data type for storing character-based data. As the name implies, alphanumeric is appropriate when a data element consists of both numbers and letters.
* The alphanumeric data type is ideal for storing product stock-keeping units (SKUs).
* It is common in the retail clothing space to have a unique SKU for each item available for sale. If you sell jeans, you may stock products from Armani Jeans, Diesel, Lee Jeans, Levi's, and Wrangler.
* Tracking inventory at the SKU level allows you to manage availability in your online and in-store systems, all courtesy of the alphanumeric data type.

# Character Sets

* When considering alphanumeric and text data types, you need to think about the character set you are using to input and store data when using a database. Databases use character sets to map, or encode, data and store it digitally. The ASCII encoding standard is based on the U.S. English alphabet.

# Numeric

* When numbers exclusively make up values for a data attribute, numeric becomes the data type of choice. This data type appears to be simple and obvious based on its name. As seen with the character data type, implementation nuances about numeric are essential to understand. Databases accommodate two types of numeric data types: integer and numeric.

# Wohole numbers 

* The integer, and all its subtypes, are for storing whole numbers. As seen with the character family of data types, implementation differences exist across databases.
* In computer science, flags indicate whether something is on or off, or if a function has completed successfully. To show something is on, 1 or TRUE is used. For a value of off, 0 or FALSE is used.
* The bit data type is intended for storing the status of a flag. Note also that the value ranges for smallint and shortinteger are identical.
* The same is true for int and integer, as well as bigint and longinteger. Although the data types have different names, their functionality is equivalent.

# Rational numbers

* In all its variants, the numeric data type is for rational numbers that include a decimal point. As with the integer family of data types, each database vendor has its implementation nuances.
* Realizing that data types are inconsistently named across databases, you need to consider the ultimate range of values a given data element handle.
* All the data types in Table 2.4 store numbers to a configurable number of significant digits.
* There are scientific use cases that require an even greater number of significant digits; additional numeric data type variants exist to accommodate that need.

# Date and time

* For example, suppose you operate a veterinary clinic and need to store birth date information for pets. In that case, you need to store the year, month, and day. With those three components of date, you can effectively administer medication and determine when to schedule annual veterinary appointments.
* There are many occasions when it is more appropriate to include time, in addition to the day, month, and year. For instance, consider package tracking information for companies like FedEx, United Parcel Service, or DHL. Consumers want to know where a specific package is up to the minute.
* The company itself may need second-level details to optimize labor, infrastructure investments, and route planning.

# Currency

* Many people use spreadsheets to manage their finances. Organizations typically use enterprise-scale software for the same purpose, with the data residing in a database.
* The column headings indicate what each column contains. The currency symbols in each cell tell the reader what the data represents, even if the column headings have scrolled off the screen.

# Strong and weak typing

* Data types define values placed in columns. Strong typing is when technology rigidly enforces data types.
* Databases, discussed in Chapter 3, use strong typing. A database column defined as numeric only accepts numerical values.
* A database column defined as numeric only accepts numerical values. You will get an error if you attempt to enter characters into a numeric column.
